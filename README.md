# 📃 **Introduction:**

My journey as a Software Engineer began from my beginnings in graphic design, to now where I've embraced the complexities of bioinformatics and proteomics data management over the past two years. My daily work involves developing and maintaining an internal data warehouse and user interface, collaborating with data scientists, and fine-tuning UI/UX designs.

I balance my full-time role with my ongoing studies in System Information & Information Technology at DIT Dublin. I am driven by the ambition to strengthen my practical knowledge in Software Design and Computer Science, striving to make my mark in the technology industry.
