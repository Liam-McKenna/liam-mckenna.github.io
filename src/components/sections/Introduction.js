      <h2>ðŸ“ƒ Introduction:</h2> My journey as a Software Engineer began from my
      beginnings in graphic design, to now where Ive embraced the complexities
      of bioinformatics and proteomics data management over the past two years.
      My daily work involves developing and maintaining an internal data
      warehouse and user interface, collaborating with data scientists, and
      fine-tuning UI/UX designs. I balance my full-time role with my ongoing
      studies in System Information & Information Technology at DIT Dublin. I am
      driven by the ambition to strengthen my practical knowledge in Software
      Design and Computer Science, striving to make my mark in the technology
      industry.
